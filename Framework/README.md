This directory contains classes intended to make analysis tasks easier by providing a common, portable framework.
The following classes are planned:

- Binning: histogram binnings for a given variable, period, etc
- Colors: Predefined color palettes for a variety of plot styles
- Cuts: Collections of cuts on analysis variables
- Maps: A set of maps/dicts/etc to convert names, map to other classes (ee.g. cut sets), etc
- Styles: Predefined plotting style parameters
- Weights: Event/sample/histogram weighting information


Implementations are matched as closely as possible in c++ and python for portability.
